# Understanding Your Current Setup

## ü§î What You Told Me:
- When you enter `projectconnect.tech` in Google/browser
- You see your complete website with frontend AND backend working
- Both are on the same URL

## üîç What I'm Seeing:
- `projectconnect.tech` returns JSON: `{"message":"ProjectConnect API","version":"1.0.0","status":"running"}`
- This looks like just the backend API response

## üéØ Questions to Clarify:

### 1. Frontend Access:
When you open `projectconnect.tech` in your browser, do you see:
- **A)** Your React website (login page, dashboard, etc.)
- **B)** Just the JSON message
- **C)** Something else?

### 2. How did you set this up?
- **A)** Did you configure a reverse proxy?
- **B)** Are you using a different Azure service?
- **C)** Did you merge frontend and backend into one application?

### 3. Current Working URLs:
- Does `projectconnect.tech` show your React app?
- Does `projectconnect.tech/api` show API responses?
- Does `projectconnect.tech/health` work for health checks?

### 4. Possible Scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Reverse Proxy Setup**
- One Azure service serves both frontend and backend
- Routes `/api/*` to backend, everything else to React

**Scenario 2: Merged Application** 
- Backend serves React build files as static assets
- API endpoints available on same domain

**Scenario 3: Different Service**
- You're using a different deployment (not the Azure App Services I'm seeing)

## üöÄ Help Me Help You:
Can you tell me what you actually see when you visit `projectconnect.tech` in your browser?

This will help me understand how to properly configure everything!
