# Custom Domain Configuration Status

## ✅ Backend Already Working!
Your backend is successfully running on your custom domain showing:
```json
{"message":"ProjectConnect API","version":"1.0.0","status":"running"}
```

## DNS Records You've Added:
- ✅ **A Record**: Points your domain to Azure IP
- ✅ **TXT Record**: For domain verification
- ✅ **Backend API**: Working perfectly

## Next Steps - Frontend Setup:

### 1. What's your custom domain?
You mentioned you set up A and TXT records. What domain are you using?
- Is it: `projectconnect.tech` for frontend?
- Is it: `api.projectconnect.tech` for backend?
- Or a different structure?

### 2. Update Frontend Configuration
Once I know your domain structure, I'll update:
- Frontend environment variables
- GitHub Actions workflow
- CORS settings

### 3. DNS Structure Options:

**Option A: Subdomain Structure**
- Frontend: `projectconnect.tech`
- Backend: `api.projectconnect.tech`

**Option B: Path Structure**  
- Frontend: `projectconnect.tech`
- Backend: `projectconnect.tech/api`

**Option C: Different Domain**
- Frontend: `app.projectconnect.tech`
- Backend: `api.projectconnect.tech`

## Tell me:
1. What URL is your backend working on?
2. What URL do you want for your frontend?
3. I'll configure everything to work together!
