# Deployment Status Monitor

## Current Deployment Progress

**Time**: August 22, 2025  
**Status**: 🔄 Building Application in Progress

### URLs to Monitor:

1. **GitHub Actions** (Build Logs): 
   - https://github.com/parthd45/projectconnect/actions

2. **Backend** (Should be working): 
   - https://projectconnect-backend-parthd-2025.azurewebsites.net/health

3. **Frontend** (Building):
   - https://projectconnect-frontend-parthd-2025.azurewebsites.net

### What's Happening Now:

✅ **Code pushed** - Latest commit: `026ad05`  
🔄 **GitHub Actions triggered** - Building React app with correct API URL  
🔄 **Frontend building** - npm install and build with environment variables  
⏳ **Azure deployment** - Will deploy to App Service after build completes  

### Expected Timeline:

- **Build Phase**: 2-3 minutes (npm install + npm run build)
- **Deploy Phase**: 1-2 minutes (upload to Azure)
- **Total Time**: ~5 minutes from commit

### Fixed Issues:

✅ Environment variables now configured in GitHub Actions  
✅ Production API URL set to Azure backend  
✅ Build process properly configured for React app  

### Next Steps After Deployment:

1. Test frontend application functionality
2. Verify API connectivity between frontend and backend
3. Configure custom domain (projectconnect.tech)
4. Final testing and optimization
