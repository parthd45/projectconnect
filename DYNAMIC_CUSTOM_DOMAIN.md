## ðŸš€ Let's Fix Your Current Azure Setup FAST:

The issue with your current deployment is the Express server setup. Let me create a simpler, faster configuration:

### Quick Fix for Current Azure App Service:
1. Remove Express server complexity
2. Use Azure Static Web Apps instead
3. Keep your backend API on Azure App Service
4. Result: 2-3 minute deployments instead of 10+

## Custom Domain Setup (Works with ALL options):
- Your domain: `projectconnect.tech`
- Frontend: `projectconnect.tech`
- Backend API: `api.projectconnect.tech`

Would you like me to:
1. **Fix your current Azure setup** to be much faster?
2. **Switch to Vercel** for lightning-fast deploys?
3. **Set up Azure Static Web Apps** as middle ground?
