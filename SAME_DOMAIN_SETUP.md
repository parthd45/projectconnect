# Setting Up Frontend + Backend on Same Domain

## 🎯 Goal: Everything on projectconnect.tech
- **Website**: https://projectconnect.tech (React frontend)  
- **API**: https://projectconnect.tech/api (Backend API)
- **One domain, complete solution!**

## Current Status:
✅ **Backend**: Working on `projectconnect.tech` 
❌ **Frontend**: Not configured yet

## 🚀 Solution: Configure Your Backend to Serve Frontend

Since your backend is already on `projectconnect.tech`, we'll configure it to:
1. **Serve your React app** for the main website
2. **Keep API endpoints** under `/api` path
3. **One domain, everything works!**

## Option 1: Update Backend to Serve Frontend (Recommended)

### Modify Your Backend Server:
I'll update your `server.js` to:
- Serve React build files for main routes
- Keep API under `/api`
- Handle React Router properly

### Benefits:
✅ One domain for everything
✅ No CORS issues  
✅ Simpler deployment
✅ Professional setup

## Option 2: Reverse Proxy Setup

Configure Azure to route:
- `/` → Frontend App Service
- `/api` → Backend App Service

## Which option do you prefer?
**Option 1** is easier and more common. Should I configure your backend to serve the frontend?
